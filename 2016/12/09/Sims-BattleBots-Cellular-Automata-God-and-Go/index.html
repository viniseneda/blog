<li><blockquote><p>If you’re building a solution, how large that solution space is gives the player a much stronger feeling of empathy. If they know that what they’ve done is unique to them, they tend to care for it a lot more. I think that’s the direction I tend to come from.</p>

<p><strong>Aqui eu visualizo aquele meu conjunto de pensamentos a respeito da memória-cognição-criação: ao ser forçado a descobrir diferentes “utilidades” de um objeto para completar um objetivo, jogar acaba construindo uma relação mais intíma com o mesmo, é quase como se houvesse uma maior “densidade de ideias” em torno de um objeto dependendo dos usos possíveis (ação, criação) que um indivíduo pode fazer dele.</strong></p>
<p>Como fundamentar essa ideia?</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p>WW: There were things that influenced me—not many though. There was a very old game called Pinball Construction Set by Bill Budge which was great. He was kind of playing around with the first pre-Mac Lisa interface, which was icon-based. He actually put this in the game, even though it was an Apple 2 game. He kind of emulated what would later become the Mac interface. But it was very easy to use, and you would create pinball sets with it which you could then play with. I thought that was very cool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pensar também no modo que os desginers e criadores interagiam com tecnologias de sua própria época. O problema da interface gráfica, por exemplo, só se tornou fundamento do desenvolvimento computacional nos dias de hoje, imagino claramente que nos primeiros computadores pessoais, pensar na interface gráfica era um dos maiores desafios do desenvolvimento. NÃO SERIA A INTERFACE O QUE DITA O DESENVOLVIMENTO?</p>
<p>A interação só poderia se realizar na interface, está na própria palavra. A imaginação criadora, necessariamente tem de pensar pela interface eu acho, já que foi através da interface –alguma– que se tornou possível pensar (no objeto?).</p>
<p>INTERFACE.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simulação contém uma relação homóloga com a duração da experiência. Começo a lmebrar dos raciocínios que usei para pensar meu projeto de pesquisa, de como a resposta imediata de um computador as ações de um usário no tempo, faz com que a identificação de realidades se confunda.</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>What’s the simplest mental model that you can walk up to one of these games and start playing it, and at least understand the basics? Now it might be the wrong model, but it still has to bootstrap into your learning process. So for most of our games, there’s some overt metaphor that allows you approach the simulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metáfora como elemento fundamental das interfaces. Não se deve esquecer que as interfaces devem se inserir no universo conhecido de uma pessoa, de modo que ela consiga operar um aparelho completamente desconhecido de si. Eu posso usar qualquer computador com Windows, posso escrever para várias maquinas em C, sendo que no fim a realdiade física dos circuitos e quase que infinitamente diferente.</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Roughly, yes. And I’m thinking that some of that will be just standardized hill climbing behavior where we’re trying to optimize variables for a particular player type. But another component could be that players do some very specific scenario or sequence of action that the computer recognizes, and says, “Hey, that’s kind of an interesting little sub-plot. Let’s try that out on some other people.” At that point, the computer is just sharing interesting things from one player and trying them out on other players. So in fact you have the players kind of cross-pollinating their creativity with each other, but it’s transparently mediated by the computer. They don’t even know whether the computer came up with this, or some other player in Oklahoma, or what. They just know that the game is doing something different today than it did yesterday.</p>
<p>You know what’s kind of interesting is right now with the storyboarding function, we’ve got players trying to reverse engineer a static model onto the computer for the most part. And in that case you’re going to have a model on the computer that’s always changing, so it’s adapting as the player’s adapting. Because basically there is this adaptive system, which is the player, slowly approaching this model on the computer, getting closer and closer in their mind to understanding the way that model works. But now you’re going to have these two models, the player model and the computer model, kind of chasing each other around. So as the player gets closer and closer to understanding the computer model, the computer will be changing into something else in response to the player’s actions. So, it’s kind of like the dog chasing its tail in a way.</p>

<p>Tudo isso que ele fala do compartilhamento de conteúdo criad pelo usuário, me parece muit a experiência de SPORE; no entanto não funcionou muito bem. Por outro lado, Minecraft, construiiu sistemas de compartilhamento auto regulados automaticamente.</p>
<p>Talvez a interferência de um mediador –servidor– seja tão ruim quanto um tipo de estado?</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: So you know, it’s parallel processing of a sort. Then you know there are these tricks about, “Okay, so how do you do that?” One thing that we found in playing with The Sims is that it’s pretty important that you have a consistent level of abstraction. It doesn’t make sense to have everything highly detailed except one aspect and then have it abstracted. So in fact you want the entire world and the entire representation to be abstracted at almost the same level. At which point it holds together very nicely. It’s kind of hard for you to go into a system and then be filling in the blanks of this one component, while everything else is highly detailed. So in The Sims, even the building is fairly abstracted. You can only put a wall within about a meter. The objects are somewhat abstracted in terms of selection: you don’t have the full selection that you would really have in a furniture store. The granules of interaction in the game are kind of abstracted. So having that consistency, in your head, you fill in the blanks really well. And this is something that kids do quite well of course. You watch kids playing with toys. They’re doing it all the time, very naturally. And even adults are doing that much of the time, with reading books, for example, where there are a lot of blanks to be filled in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O que é essa abstraction?</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: In Go, both players have a model of what’s happening on the board, and over time those models get closer and closer and closer together until the final score. At that point you have a total shared model of, you know, “you beat me.” (Laughter.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, manifestação das incertezas, definição de um estado. GO seria a pura determinação da realidade na duração.</p>
<p>Will Wright tem uma definição de <em>Mental Model</em> muito interessante</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WW: I don’t think so. I mean it’s interesting. I’m just surprised that people can do that fluidly, they can so fluidly say “Oh, I’m this guy, and then I’m going to do x, y, and z.” And then they can pop out and “Now I’m that person. I’m doing this that and the other. What’s he doing?” And so now he’s a third person to me, even though he was me a moment ago. I think that’s something we use a lot in our imaginations when we’re modeling things. We’ll put ourselves in somebody else’s point of view very specifically for a very short period of time. “Well, let’s see, if I were that person, I would probably do x, y, and z.” And then I kind of jump out of their head and then I’m me, talking to them, relating to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mas ainda sim ele parece se distânciar um pouco de razões mais profundas pra justificar as ações dos jogadores. Ele se aproxima de teorias da psicologia e da filosofia com seu pensamento sobre modelos mentai, mas faz isso a uma distância muito segura talvez. Eu ja imagino que nossa separação, entre o eu e o mundo, é muito mais melada. (How We Became Posthuman e Questões da comunicação e da cognição).</p>
<p>A noção de avatar também é interessate. Reler esse trecho e escrever sobre os limites da opinião colcoada na entrevista e o meu atual conhecimento sobre o assunto. (talves ele não pense que os indivísuos realmente se tornem seus avatares.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>WW: That’s going to be a very different game, because there’s no autonomy behind the characters at all. They’re total avatars. We’re trying to design the game with a very social focus, obviously.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isso muda um pouco o modo de pensar a interação da identidade das pessoas com os personagens virtuais. Quando realmente se interage com outros seres humanos é uma experiência completamente diferente de interagir com figuras humanas, como as do modo single player do the sims.</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: Right, I mean what I really want to do is I want to create just the largest possibility space I can. I don’t want to create a specific possibility that everybody’s going to experience the same way. I’d much rather have a huge possibility space where every player has as unique an experience as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Como minecraft atinge um possibility space gigantesco através de uma mímica da nossa forma de criar objetos e a realidade na nossa relação da consciência com o conhecimento e com o espaço. No The sims os objetos são “comprados”, mas o espaço e a memoria dos objetos é construida. <strong>Isso tem relação com a “densidade das ideias”</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WW: That’s a good question. Because I think you could always make the possibility space larger at the expense of the plausibility or the dramatic potential, or the quality of the experience. There’s probably some relationship between the quality of the experience and the size of the possibility space. So we can make the possibility space huge, just by giving the player a thousand numbers. And “Here, you can make any one of these thousand numbers whatever you want it to be.” That’s a big space. It’s just not a very high quality experience. So we start wrapping graphics, sounds scenarios and events around those numbers, and we’re increasing the quality of the experience you have. It has more meaning to you. In some sense it becomes more evocative. You can start wrapping a mental model around that, as opposed to this pile of numbers.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: Well, she’s really into Japanese anime. She’s been showing me some of this stuff that is really amazing. There’s this one called Serial Experiments Lain. It’s got so much of The Matrix in it, and what’s interesting, is then you realize that it was made three years before The Matrix. Except it’s much more twisted than The Matrix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isso é a plavra final de que ele praticamente não tem conhecimento do que faz num nível filosófico/psicológico, dos limites do indivíduo e os androids.(embora ele não esteja tratando de androids diretamente, mas se apoia na comunicação de tal forma, que certamente influência muito nas determinaçãoes do subjetivo)</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: I’ve always wanted to make a game that had a smooth slider where you could go forward and backward and rebranch very, very easily so that at any point I could just pull the slider back and then right there do something, then pull it back again and do something different. And so you’d be kind of interactivity exploring the possibility space, but you’d have equal mobility forward and backward and time. Right now, you have a lot of mobility forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OH</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: Well, it seems like that should be the case. Frequently there are technical limitations as to why we can’t just instantly jump ahead because <strong>we in fact have to simulate all the interim stuff</strong>. But that seems like that should be one of the huge advantages of that medium is the fact that you have that time mobility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ISSO É MUITO IMPORTANTE </p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>WW: Reversible simulations are hard in some sense, though. I mean, this gets into a whole computer science discussion. But, you either store the data or you make it reversible. It can only be made reversible if no information is destroyed. Most simulation processes, such as system dynamics or cellular automata, destroy information.</p>
